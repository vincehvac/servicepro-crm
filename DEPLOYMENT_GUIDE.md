```

**Important**: Add these for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel
- Check build logs for specific errors
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure package.json has correct dependencies
- Try building locally: `npm run build`

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify Supabase URL and key are correct
- Check if Supabase project is active
- Ensure RLS policies are set up correctly
- Check Supabase logs for errors

### Authentication Not Working
- Verify redirect URLs in Supabase
- Check that environment variables are set in Vercel
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check browser console for errors

### 404 Errors

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit .env.local to Git** (already in .gitignore)
2. **Use strong passwords** for Supabase database
3. **Enable 2FA** on Vercel and Supabase accounts
4. **Regularly update dependencies**: `npm update`
5. **Monitor for security vulnerabilities**: `npm audit`
6. **Review RLS policies** to ensure data security
7. **Use HTTPS only** (Vercel provides this automatically)

## Scaling Considerations

### When to Upgrade Supabase
- Free tier: 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth
- Upgrade when approaching limits
- Consider Pro plan for production apps

### When to Upgrade Vercel
- Free tier: 100GB bandwidth, unlimited deployments
- Upgrade for team features or higher limits
